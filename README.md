# Hyderabad_House_Prices_Analysis

In the current repository we wil try to clean and analyse the data extracted in the [Hyderabad_House_Prices](https://github.com/saitejamahadev/Hyderabad_Housing_Prices) repository 
and try to answer questions such as 

   * What is the common Fursnhing style of the flat avaliable for rent ?
   * What type of Tennants are generally preferred by Landlords ?
   * How many number of Bedrooms are generally availabel for rent ?
   * What is the distribution of Furnishing type vs Tennants repferred ?

## Steps :

* Import the data from the .CSV file saved previously.
* Identify the feaures that needs preprocessing or cleaning or that have missing values.
* Preprocess the Data.
* Save the Data into .CSV file.
* Visualize and draw insights from the data.

## Dependencies :

* Pandas.
* Matplotlib.
* Stastistics Library.
* Regular Expressions.

## Navigation :

1. First run the Hoseu_Prices_Preprocessing.ipynb using Hyderabad_House_Data.CVS
2. Next run the House_Prices_Data_Visualization.ipynb using the Hyderabad_House_Data_Cleaned.CVS

## Answers :
